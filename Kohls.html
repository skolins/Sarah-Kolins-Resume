			<p class="subpageText">During Summer 2012 I received an amazing opportunity to intern for Kohl’s in Web Merchandise Presentation.<br />  During my time at Kohl’s I was given responsibility for ad sets, assorting, attributing, and many other areas.<br /> Not only did I get a well-rounded experience because of taking on these roles, but these responsibilities also<br /> prepared me for the time at the end of the summer when my coordinator went on vacation and I was assigned<br /> these aspects of her job. In addition to the day-to-day practices that I learned, I was also part of a team with<br /> four other interns. Over eight weeks we worked closely together to create an analysis of the Millennial generation<br /> and recommendations for Kohl’s.  We gave a presentation of our findings to sixty people including upper management.<br /> The ideas were so well received that parts will be implemented and we were asked to repeat the presentation for<br /> the buying team. This was an amazing learning experience in team work, organization, and stress management.<br /> Please see below for examples of work on the Kohl's website.</p>
